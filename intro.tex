% introducing directional wavelets
In image compression and analysis, 2D tensor wavelet schemes are widely used. Despite the time-frequency localization inherited from 1D wavelet, 2D tensor wavelets suffers from poor orientation selectivity: only horizontal or vertical edges are well represented by tensor wavelets. To obtain better representation of 2D images, several directional wavelet schemes have been proposed and applied to image processing, including directional wavelet filterbanks(DFB), contourlet, curvelet, shearlet and dual-tree wavelet.

% summary
Conventional DFB \cite{DFB92} divides the frequency domain into eight equi-angular pairs of triangles and it is critically downsampled (maximally decimated) and perfect reconstruction (PR), but without multi-resolution structure. 
A non-uniform DFB(nuDFB) is introduced in \cite{nuDFB05} where the high frequency ring is divided into six equi-angular pairs of trapezoids and the central low frequency square is kept for division in the next level of decomposition. The nuDFB is solved directly by optimization which provides a non-unique near orthogonal or bi-orthogonal solution depending on the initialization.
Contourlets \cite{do2005contourlet} combine the Laplacian pyramid scheme with DFB which has PR but with redundancy $4/3$ inherited from the Laplacian pyramid.
Shearlet \cite{shearlet12book,easley2008sparse} and curvelet \cite{candes2006fast} systems construct a multi-resolution partition of the frequency domain by applying shear or rotation operators to a generator function in each level. Depending on the generator function and the number of directions, available shearlet and curvelet implementations have redundancy at least 4; moreover, the factor may grow with the decomposition level.
% to be modified and add M-band version
Dual-tree wavelets \cite{selesnick2005dual} are linear combinations of 2D tensor wavelets (corresponding to multi-resolution systems) that constitute an approximate Hilbert transform pair. 

% what's the problem we will address, don't focusing too much on shearlet for the moment
None of these schemes is PR, critically downsampled and regularized (localized in both time and frequency) with multi-resolution structure. 
In the framework of nuDFB (\cite{nuDFB05}), it is shown by Durand \cite{durand2007} that it's impossible to construct orthonormal filters localized in frequency without discontinuity in their frequency support, or equivalently regularized filters without aliasing. His construction of directional filters using compositions of 2-band filters associated to quincunx lattice, similar to that of uniform DFB in \cite{nuDFB05} and as pointed out in \cite{nuDFB05} the overall composed filters are not alias-free.
%Among these,  shearlets and curvelets have optimal asymptotic rate of approximation for ``cartoon images''(piecewise smooth, with jumps occurring along piecewise $C^2$-curves), due to the parabolic scaling rule in the frequency domain \cite{guo2007optimally,candes2005curvelet}; they have been successfully applied to image denoising \cite{easley2009shearlet}, restoration \cite{candes2002new} and separation \cite{kutyniok2012image}. Despite their theoretical potential, the (often high) redundancy of curvelets and shearlets impedes their practical usage. 
%Redundancy is useful in image processing tasks such as denoising, restoration and reconstruction, but a non-redundant basis decomposition is preferred in tasks where computation cost is of concern.

In this paper, we consider multi-resolution directional wavelets corresponding to the same partition of frequency domain as nuDFB and build a framework to analyze the equivalent conditions of PR for critically downsampled and more generally redundant schemes. In our previous work \cite{yin2014orthshear}, we show that in multi-resolution analysis(MRA), PR is equivalent to an identity condition and shift-cancellation condition closely related to the frequency support of filters and their downsampling scheme. Based on these two conditions, we derive Durand's discontinuity result of orthonormal schemes and a relaxation of orthonormal schemes to frame with redundancy 2 that resolves the regularity limitation. A regularized directional wavelet scheme of redundancy 2 that satisfies the identity condition and the relaxed shift-cancellation condition, is constructed directly by smoothing the Fourier transform of the corresponding wavelet.
We extend our previous work here and show that the same irregularity in orthonormal schemes exists in bi-orthogonal schemes. Our analysis of bi-orthogonal schemes is based on a numerical algorithm introduced by Cohen et al in \cite{cohen1993compactly} for constructing compactly supported symmetric wavelet bases on hexagonal lattice. We extend and adapt this algorithm to our bi-orthogonal framework.

The paper is organized as follows, in section \ref{sec: setup}, we set up our framework of a dyadic MRA with dilated quincunx downsampling. In section \ref{sec: orth}, we review the irregularity of orthonormal schemes in \cite{yin2014orthshear}. In particular, we derive two conditions, {\it identity summation} and {\it shift cancellation}, equivalent to perfect reconstruction in this MRA with critical downsampling. These lead to the classification of {\it regular/singular} boundaries of the frequency partition %and the corresponding smoothing techniques to improve spatial localization. We compare our and Durand's directional wavelet constructions. 
%In section \ref{sec: frame}, 
and a {\it relaxed shift-cancellation} condition for low-redundancy MRA frame allows better regularity of the directional wavelets. 
In section \ref{sec: bi-orth}, we show the irregularity for bi-orthogonal schemes. We first review the wavelet construction algorithm in \cite{cohen1993compactly} which solves linear systems generated from regularity constraints. Next, we extend the algorithm to our framework and show that the resulting linear system doesn't have feasible solution satisfying all regularity constraints, especially continuity of Fourier transforms of wavelet filters.  
Finally, we conclude our results and discuss future work in section \ref{sec: end}.
