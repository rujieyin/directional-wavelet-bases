\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec: end}
In this paper, we consider directional wavelet schemes on dilated quincunx sub-lattice and analyze their regularity. We show that filters in bi-orthogonal bases have the same discontinuity in the frequency domain as that of the orthonormal bases at the corners of $S_1 = [-\pi/2,\pi/2)\times[-\pi/2,\pi/2)$, hence they cannot be not well localized in the time domain. 

%Our analysis is closely related to our proposed bases construction algorithms, 
%and we show that the construction method of orthonormal bases can be easily extended to build frames construction of redundancy 2, which achieve much better time frequency localization and thus practically useful.
 We construct the bi-orthogonal taking a different approach from the orthonormal case, where directional dual filters are first designed such that they can be completed to a bi-orthogonal frame and the remaining filters are obtained by solving feasible linear systems or quadratic optimization. 
 Its extension to low-redundancy dual frame construction is not studied here and will be our future focus.
